# Software-Construction

* Low level C programming and memory allocation
* Programmed in C to create a program through random bytes
* Bytes could be generated in various ways, from inputted files, or through hardware or software means
* Memory allocation in the form of buffers using malloc(), outputting N kb at a time
* Use getopt to parse through varying forms of input
